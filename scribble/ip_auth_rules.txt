Overall rules:
 * Determine if a new IP needs to be added at all.
 * No member vs. guest partitioning: if list has space, just add the new IP.
 * If no space, find one to evict. LRU removal on guest, then LRU on members if no guests.

Pseudocode:

if ip exists:
    just update existing auth info
if member auth and user exists:
    just remove old IP and add new IP/info
    # note these IPs must be different due to first condition
if list full:
    remove lru entry and add new
otherwise:
    add new
