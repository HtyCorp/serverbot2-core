General notes on things that *might* be problems later but aren't worth worrying about now, to check in case something
does go wrong and is worse than expected.

NetSec prefix list: setting data key has a race condition
 * This is set permanently the first time the prefix list is ever read/written, so this only matters if there are
   unlucky concurrent executions that first time.

NetSec prefix list: can't update entry descriptions in a single operation
 * This makes use cases like updating/refreshing a temporary entry more difficult.
