ECS deployment:
 * corretto11 is based on AL2 -> has AWS CLI v1 pre-installed
 * update by creating new task def with updated relay artifact S3 location in its entrypoint
 * "ecs-patterns" module no good - assumes using a load-balanced service. Relay is outbound-only by design
 * need to explore "ecs" module to see if it can be used for a basic deployment
Step functions definition:
 * Find way to integrate API models into state CDK constructs: guarantee SFn is generating expected JSON
Discord relay:
 * Static SQS queue?
CodeBuild:
 * Use local build step bash scripts in buildpsec, instead of running commands directly?

Ubuntu image locator:
 * Example URL ('_' value is epoch milli time): https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/releasesTable?_=1588837725000
 * JSON payload containing table of latest AMIs
